Function Literals
-----------------

example of functions in monkey looks like below: we define which params they have and 
what the function do
```js
fn(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

funcion starts with `fn` keyword followed by list of params. followed by block statement.

```js
fn <parameters> <block statement>

// params
(<parameter one>, <parameter two>, <parameter three>, ...)

// params are just a list of identifiers that are comma-seperated
// they can also be empty
```
